      '<h1>Email Forwarding</h1> \n <p>The IEEE email forwarding system makes it possible for emails sent to your @ieee.ucla.edu email to also be forwarded to another address of your choice.</p> <blockquote>Emails that go to webmaster@ieee.ucla.edu will also go to jeffschan97@gmail.com</blockquote> <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: With our current email forwarding system, you can’t “send emails to yourself.” Using the example above, I would not be able to send an email TO webmaster@ieee.ucla.edu FROM jeffschan97@gmail.com (the address I have it set to forward to). It will show up in the inbox of webmaster@ieee.ucla.edu but not within jeffschan97@gmail.com. This is important because I know some of you test the email forwarding this way. Any other email would work just fine.</p> <pre><code>() => { return "Hello" } \nconsole.log("hello, world!"); \nconsole.log("hi");</code></pre>'
